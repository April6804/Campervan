# Bluegrass Campervan

## Description
```
A website for a club of people who like to camp in campervans in Kentucky. Site shows popular campsites and pictures of different campervans.

```



## Custom CSS Classes
```
The class(es) I created are:

1. Hero and hero-overlay classes apply a large image to each page and the ability to lay the page's h1 and h2 on top of them.

2. Events, dates and description classes are on the About page showing events, the dates, and descriptions for each event.

3. Flexbox and lightbox classes are on the Gallery page to display the images on the page in a responsive grid and allow JS to display each image larger after clicking on an image.

4. btn class is on the Contact page for a custom button that uploads files and resembles the submit button.

```



## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I created are:

1. openModal, closeModal, showSlides and other lightbox functions are on my app.js page. They display each image based on what image you clicked on with a dark background. Each image has a previous and next button to display other images.

2. getFile and sub(obj) are also on the app.js file and allows my custom button to upload a file to be included in a contact form. Of course it is only for a demo and doesn't actually upload the image and send it anywhere.
