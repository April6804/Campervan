## Custom CSS Classes and IDs

The class(es) and ID(s) I created are:

* Hero and hero-overlay classes apply a large image to each page and the ability to lay the page's h1 and h2 on top of them.

* Events, dates, and description classes are on the About page showing events, the dates, and descriptions for each event.

* Flexbox ~~and lightbox~~ classes are on the Gallery page to display the images on the page in a responsive grid ~~and allow JS to display each image larger after clicking on an image.~~

* btn ID is on the Contact page for a custom button that uploads files and resembles the submit button.





## Custom JavaScript Functions

The javascript functions I created are:

* ~~ openModal, closeModal, showSlides and other lightbox functions are on my app.js page. They display each image based on what image you clicked on with a dark background. Each image has a previous and next button to display other images.~~

* Hamburger menu in nav appears on smaller screens with a drop down menu when clicked.

* getFile and sub(obj) are also on the app.js file and allows my custom button to upload a file to be included in a contact form. Of course it is only for a demo and doesn't actually upload the image and send it anywhere.

* If viewed on an iPhone then JS adds a class to the html on the Contact page to adjust the width of my custom btn.
